     <h1>Life And Baseball  </h1>
        <h2><em>By: Chris Gress </em> </h2>
    
        
    
    <p>Life and baseball are nearly the same.<br><br></p>
    <p> The Highs, The <strong>Lows.</strong></p>
    <p> The Balls, The <strong>Strikes. </strong> </p>
    
    <p>You live, one day at a time.</p>
    <p>You play the game, one pitch at a time.</p>
    <p>The Past is <strong> gone,</strong> but not forgotten.</p>
    <p>The Future looks<strong> bright,</strong> but is not guaranteed.</p>  
    <p>Life, is about the <em> Little Things.</em></p>
    <p> Baseball, is about the <em> fundamentals.</em></p>
    <p>In life you stay<strong> humble, </strong> but not <em> timid.</em></p> 
    <p> In baseball you stay <strong> confident,</strong> but not <em> cocky.</em></p>
